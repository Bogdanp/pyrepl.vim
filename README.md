PyREPL
======

PyREPL is a Vim plugin that provides a way to run something similar
to a Python REPL inside a Vim buffer.

# Example use

You can watch a video of it in action [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4qT2BbOHbE).

#Installation

Installing is simple enough, just copy the `plugin` folder to `~/.vim`
and you're set.

#Usage

Inside any buffer use `\r` to toggle the REPL on or off. Toggling it on
will create a new empty buffer every single time.

#Todo

    [*] Make the thing work with blocks.
    [ ] Add support for nested blocks.
