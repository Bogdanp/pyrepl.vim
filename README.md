PyREPL
======

PyREPL is a Vim plugin that provides a way to run something similar
to a Python REPL inside a Vim buffer. As of yet the REPL only works
with simple statements. 

Installation
============

Installing is simple enough, just copy the `plugin` folder to `~/.vim`
and you're set.

Usage
=====

Inside any buffer use `\r` to toggle the REPL on or off.
