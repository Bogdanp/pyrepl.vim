PyREPL
======

PyREPL is a Vim plugin that provides a way to run something similar
to a Python REPL inside a Vim buffer. As of yet the REPL only works
with simple statements. You can watch a vide of it in action at
[https://github.com/Bogdanp/pyrepl.vim/blob/master/plugin/pyrepl.vim](https://github.com/Bogdanp/pyrepl.vim/blob/master/plugin/pyrepl.vim).

Installation
============

Installing is simple enough, just copy the `plugin` folder to `~/.vim`
and you're set.

Usage
=====

Inside any buffer use `\r` to toggle the REPL on or off.

Todo
====

* Make the thing work with blocks.
